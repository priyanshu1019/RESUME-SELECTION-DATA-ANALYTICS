## Project Overview

The Resume Selection project aims to streamline the resume screening process by leveraging machine learning algorithms. It automatically classifies resumes into predefined categories based on their textual content, reducing manual effort and enhancing the accuracy of the selection process.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for implementing the machine learning models.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Library for machine learning, including Naive Bayes classifier and CountVectorizer.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For plotting and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For creating and sharing the code.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains resumes labeled with categories indicating their suitability for various job roles. The data is preprocessed to convert textual content into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.

## Algorithms

- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Used for classifying resumes based on text features.
- **CountVectorizer**: Converts text data into a matrix of token counts.

## Results

- **Accuracy**: 88% on the test dataset.
- **Precision**: 100% for the positive class.
- **Recall**: 25% for the positive class.
- **F1-Score**: 0.40 for the positive class.
- **Processing Time Reduction**: 30% decrease in average resume processing time.
